## Express JS File Structure
This file structure template is based on a simple MVC directory structure. This is going to be used as a base template for my Node with Express JS projects.

This was created to with the following packages as default:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Nodemon


## Environment Variables

The following env variables are required:

`APP_PORT` - port for the Node instance

`MONGODB_URI` - URI for the Mongo Atlas connection

## Usage/Examples
After cloning this directory in the local development environment, run the `npm run dev` command to run the Node instance with Nodemon.


## Roadmap

- Add default logging library
